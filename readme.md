sample spigot plugin
based on this ancient archetype https://github.com/callisto-systems/spigot-archetype
published as https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/ro.coderdojo.spigot/spigot-template/1.0

after you clone this, you need to run [buildtools](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools/) if you haven't on this machine yet (for the specific version of bukkit/spigot you are targeting)

and string-replace `fulton-recovery` :)
